    <h1>FIZZBUZZ CHALLENGE</h1>
    <p id = "desc">Here is a Challenge that prints all numbers from 1 to 100 with two exceptions. For number divisible by 3, it prints "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), it prints "Buzz" instead of the number and then the challenge is modified to print "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still prints "Fizz" and "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those)</p>
